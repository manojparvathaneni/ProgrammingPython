For a cloud-native developer, focusing solely on Kubernetes and Docker isn't enough. The cloud-native ecosystem is vast, and several technologies play a crucial role in developing, deploying, and managing applications efficiently. Here's a breakdown of essential technologies and tools, besides Kubernetes and Docker, that a cloud-native developer should be familiar with:
1. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

    Tools: Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, GitHub Actions
    Purpose: Automate the steps of software delivery to integrate code changes more frequently and reliably.

2. Service Mesh

    Tools: Istio, Linkerd, Consul Connect
    Purpose: Facilitates service-to-service communication in a secure, fast, and reliable way. It helps in handling service discovery, load balancing, encryption, authentication, and authorization without requiring changes to the code.

3. Configuration Management

    Tools: Ansible, Terraform, Puppet, Chef
    Purpose: Automate the configuration of software and systems. Helps in managing infrastructure as code, leading to faster setup and consistent environments.

4. Monitoring and Logging
